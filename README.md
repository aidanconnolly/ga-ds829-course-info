Welcome to the part time Data Science course at General Assembly!

In our part-time course, we will use Python (currently v2.7) to explore datasets, build predictive models, and communicate data driven insights. 

Specifically, you will learn to:

- Define the language and approaches used by data scientists to solve real world problems.
- Perform exploratory data analysis with powerful programmatic tools, including the command line, python, and pandas.
- Build and refine basic machine learning models to predict patterns from data sets.
- Communicate data driven insights to peers and stakeholders in order to inform business decisions.
