Welcome to the part time Data Science course at General Assembly!

In our part-time course, we will use Python (currently v2.7) to explore datasets, build predictive models, and communicate data driven insights. 

Specifically, you will learn to:

- Define the language and approaches used by data scientists to solve real world problems.
- Perform exploratory data analysis with powerful programmatic tools, including the command line, python, and pandas.
- Build and refine basic machine learning models to predict patterns from data sets.
- Communicate data driven insights to peers and stakeholders in order to inform business decisions.

We'll be using Slack for our in-class communications. Slack is a messaging platform where you can chat with your peers and instructors. We will use Slack to share information about the course, discuss lessons, and submit projects. Our Slack homepage is [X](x).

**Pro Tip**: If you've never used Slack before, check out these resources:

## Office Hours
Every week, your instructional team will hold office hours where you can get in touch to ask questions about anything relating to the course. This is a *great opportunity* to follow up on questions or ask for more details about any topics covered so far.

* Instructor's Office Hours - Day, Time (or by Appointment)
* Assistant's Office Hours - Day, Time (or by Appointment)

Slack us or post in our #officehours channel to reserve a time-slot!
